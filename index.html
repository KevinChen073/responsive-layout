            Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep<br/>
            Dreaming about the things that we could be<br/>
            But baby I've been, I've been prayin' hard<br/>
            Said no more counting dollars<br/>
            We'll be counting stars<br/>
            Yeah, we'll be counting stars<br/>
            I see this life<br/>
            Like a swinging vine<br/>
            Swing my heart across the line<br/>
            In my faces flashing signs<br/>
            Seek it out and ye shall find<br/>
            Old, but I'm not that old<br/>
            Young, but I'm not that bold<br/>
            And I don't think the world is sold<br/>
            I'm just doing what we're told<br/>
            I feel something so right<br/>
            By doing the wrong thing<br/>
            I feel something so wrong<br/>
            By doing the right thing<br/>
            I could lie, could lie, could lie<br/>
            Everything that kills me makes me feel alive<br/>
            Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep<br/>
            Dreaming about the things that we] could be<br/>
            Baby I've been, I've been prayin' hard<br/>
            Said no more counting dollars<br/>
            We'll be counting stars<br/>
            Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep<br/>
            Dreaming about the things that we could be<br/>
            But baby I've been, I've been prayin' hard<br/>
            Said no more counting dollars<br/>
            We'll be, we'll be counting stars<br/>
            I feel the love<br/>
            And I feel it burn<br/>
            Down this river every turn<br/>
            Hope is a four letter word<br/>
            Make that money<br/>
            Watch it burn<br/>
            Old, but I'm not that old<br/>
            Young, but I'm not that bold<br/>
            And I don't think the world is sold<br/>
            I'm just doing what we're told<br/>
            I, feel something so wrong<br/>
            Bydoing the right thing<br/>
            I could lie, could lie, could lie<br/>
            Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly<br/>
            Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep<br/>
            Dreaming about the things that we could be<br/>
            Baby I been, I been prayin' hard<br/>
            Said no more counting dollars<br/>
            We'll be counting stars<br/>
            Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep<br/>
            Dreaming 'bout the things that we could be<br/>
            But baby I've been, I've been prayin' hard<br/>
            Said no more counting dollars<br/>
            We'll be, we'll be counting stars<br/>
            Take that money and watch it burn<br/>
            Sink in the river the lessons I learned<br/>
